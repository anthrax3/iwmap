By default interface is setting to wlan0. If you use a different interface then open iwmap file and replace variable with your interface:

   WLAN="wlan0"


Variable settings:

  WLAN="wlan0"        # <- Interface type
  LOGFILE="iwmap.log" # <- Logfile name
  SLEEP=10	      # <- Delay in seconds
  SU="sudo"	      # <- Super User


To use iwmap:

   # cd path/to/iwmap
   # bash iwmap


Alternatively copy iwmap on /usr/local/bin and run:

   # iwmap
